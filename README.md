You nerds should know how to run this but I'll provide some information:

1) Uses Angular 20, which needs to be installed along with node (LTS).
2) Runs with `npm start`
3) Builds with a simple pipeline into netlify using `npm run build`

If you can't do that much, give up and take up another career.
